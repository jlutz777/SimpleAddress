SimpleAddress
=============

SimpleAddress is a simple address web application for viewing, searching, adding, editing, and exporting your personal address list.

This is very much a learning project with an express purpose of using new technologies in an intent to learn.  In doing so, it is needlessly complex at times.

Technologies used:
Python
Bottle micro web framework
gunicorn
Cork (bottle-cork)
MongoDB (hosted on MongoHQ)
AngularJS
UI bootstrap
Jinja templating
Koding for developing
Heroku for deploying and hosting

Currently the following aspects are not completed:
Searching
Advanced filtering
Authentication

Feel free to borrow/steal any code you see.  I want others to learn as much as I did.
