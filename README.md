SimpleAddress
=============

SimpleAddress is a simple address web application for viewing, searching, adding, editing, and exporting your personal address list.

This is very much a learning project with an express purpose of using new technologies in an intent to learn.  In doing so, it is needlessly complex at times.

<b>Technologies used:</b><br />
Python<br />
Bottle micro web framework<br />
gunicorn<br />
Cork (bottle-cork)<br />
MongoDB (hosted on MongoHQ)<br />
AngularJS<br />
UI bootstrap<br />
Jinja templating<br />
Koding for developing<br />
Heroku for deploying and hosting<br />
PEP8, PyFlakes, and PEP257<br />

<b>Currently the following aspects are not completed:</b><br />
Searching<br />
Advanced filtering<br />

Feel free to borrow/steal any code you see.  I want others to learn as much as I did.
