SimpleAddress
=============

SimpleAddress is a simple address program built with python, bottle, mongo, angular, and UI bootstrap.  The project served two primary purposes, which are important to keep in mind if you choose to use or edit it.  The first purpose was to learn more.  I wanted to use mongo, angular, and UI bootstrap for the first time while learning more about python and bottle, which I had previously used. The second purpose was to make a very simple address tracking program that allows viewing, searching, adding, and editing, along with a CSV export.

At the moment searching and advanced filtering isn't available, but it'll come with time.

If I'm doing something completely newbie or terrible, feel free to let me know, as I'm learning.
